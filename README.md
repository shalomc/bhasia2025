## Getting started
You must have a compatible Excel version and subscription to 
run Python scripts in Excel. For more information, read the Microsoft Instructions [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/data-security-and-python-in-excel-33cc88a4-4a87-485e-9ff9-f35958278327).

You do not need python to exist on your PC, 
although python is required if you plan to expand and test some scripts locally before running them in Excel.
A `requirements.txt` file is included in the repository to help you install the required packages.

The respository will be updated with new examples and scripts as we progress in our research.
